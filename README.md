# Telco Customer Churn Analysis : Proactive Retention Strategy

## Project Overview

------


## Business Problem
In the telecommunications (telco) sector, customer churn is the rate at which subscribers stop using a provider’s services either by canceling their subscription plan entirely or switching to a competitor and this concept is a primary threat to stability of the industry. Because the market is saturated, as retaining existing customers is of grerat concern for a telco firm to remain in business. 

The goal of this analysis is to build a predictive framework that identifies subscribers at high risk of voluntary churn. 
By analyzing patterns in customer demographics, service usage, and contract types, we aim to:
- Identify the key drivers of churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, or technical issues).
- Predict which individual customers are likely to stop using the provider's services.
- Propose data-driven retention strategies to protect Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).
